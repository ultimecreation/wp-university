# wp-university

This project consist of a theme created from scratch using the template hierarchy.

Also the backend has been created and customized using MU-plugins :
[MU-Plugins ](https://github.com/ultimecreation/wp-university/tree/master/wp-content/mu-plugins)

Some plugins have been build using Object Oriented Programming (Abstract Classes)

Some new tables have been added to handle the Many to Many and Many to One relations between the professors, campuses, events and programs. I've also created custom meta boxes and fields to update the different tables in database after sanitizing the users data.

A Google Map has been added programmaticly along with Pins to display multiple locations on the same Map (no plugin)
